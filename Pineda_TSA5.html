                and the main protagonist of the Dragon Ball series. He is the second born, as well as youngest son and
                child of Bardock and Gine, the husband of Chi-Chi, and the father of Gohan and Goten. Originally sent to
                Earth by his parents as an infant, Kakarot was adopted by Grandpa Gohan and renamed Son Goku. A head
                injury at an early age altered Goku's memory, ridding him of his initial destructive nature and allowing
                him to grow up to become one of Earth's greatest defenders. Goku constantly strives and trains to be the
                greatest warrior possible, which has kept the Earth and the universe safe from destruction multiple
                times.</p>

                by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the
                village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years,
                through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja, regarded as a hero both by the villagers,
                and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (木ノ葉隠れの英雄,
                Konohagakure no Eiyū, literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves). He soon proved to be one of
                the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become
                the village's Seventh Hokage (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, literally meaning: Seventh Fire Shadow).</p>
